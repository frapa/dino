== MAP STRUCTURE

Any entity is saved in the map file. There are:

  * STATIC ENTITIES
    These are entities that do not move, i.e. tiles. Such entities are subdivided into two *classes*:

      - SPRITES
        These entities live in the tile level and are images.

        Fields: LABELS, *X, *Y, *CLASS, *TYPE, RECT
        * indicates compulsory fields

      - BLOCKS
        These entities are just GL_QUADS use to fill the gaps without using and loading to many images.
    
        Fields: LABELS, *VERTICES, *COLOR, *CLASS, RECT
        * indicates compulsory fields
      
      - COLLISION
        Entities used only for collision purpose.

        Fields: *CLASS, *RECT, *FRICTION, LABELS
